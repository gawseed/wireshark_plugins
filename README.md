Wireshark Plugins -- Lua Source

INTRODUCTION
============

This repository contains plugins for Wireshark that are written in Lua.

As currently set up, most of these plugins will live in the user's Wireshark
directory, which is ~/.wireshark.  We may want to have a system-level
directory for plugins; that shouldn't be difficult to put together.
